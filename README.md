# CyberSlayer (Work in progress)
<p>
The game is a slasher in 2D format. This means that more time the player destroys opponents (in the open) than jumps and moves around the level. The game also has locations without opponents for immersion in the outside world.
</p>
<p>
The main plot is presented through cutscenes in the format of comics (key moments) and through the communication of the GG with other characters in the form of clouds of dialogs (secondary issues).
</p>
<p>
The game is to some extent tied to the use of parkour for completing missions and battles with enemies. Technique list: tackle, rebound from the wall, climbing.
</p>
<p>
The main character does not have a ranged weapon in the game.
</p>
<p>
As you progress through the story, the game will be saved at checkpoints (to which the player will return in case of death.
</p>
<p>
The design of the levels, although linear, but as you progress through the player will have choices that may slightly affect the following missions.
